# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Project

### Uncovering the factors that determined survival on the RMS Titanic using Python and Tableau.

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a data analysis and visualization endeavor aimed at investigating the demographic and social factors that influenced survival rates during the sinking of the RMS Titanic.

The analysis answers key historical questions by leveraging the power of **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and preparation, and **Tableau** for creating an interactive, insightful [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Titanic_17636386242300/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## ✨ Key Questions Answered

The dashboard directly addresses and visualizes the impact of the following factors on survival rates:

1.  **Did Age Affect Survival?**
2.  **Did Class Affect Survival?**
3.  **Did Being Alone Affect Survival?**

## 📊 Visualizations and Insights

The core of this project is the Tableau dashboard, which provides the following key visualizations (as seen in the project image):

* **Survival Rate by Class (Bar Chart):** Clearly shows the vast difference in survival probability across **1st, 2nd, and 3rd class** passengers, highlighting the "money matters" reality of the disaster.
    * *Insight:* 1st Class passengers had the highest average survival rate.

* **Survival Rate by Age Group (Treemap):** Breaks down survival by categories like **Child**, **Teen**, **Young Adult**, **Adult**, and **Senior**, demonstrating the "women and children first" protocol's effect.
    * *Insight:* Children generally had higher survival rates than other age groups.

* **Survival by Being Alone (Pie Chart):** Compares the survival percentages of those traveling alone versus those with family.
    * *Insight:* Passengers **not alone** (traveling with family) had a slightly higher survival rate than those traveling alone.
